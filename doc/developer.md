# The Webelexis Developer's Handbook

## Prerequisites, install and launch

node >= 10
jdk >=8
elexis running on a slightly modified mysql database (run `server/modify_elexis.sql` for the modifications)

... as needed ...:

    cd server
    npm install
    npm rebuild node-sass
    npm remove java
    npm install java
    cd lib
    ./fetch.sh
    cd ..
    npm start

the development server runs on port 3030

    cd ../client
    npm install
    au run --watch --hmr

the webpack development server runs on port 9000    

## DataSource and DataService

To apply CRUD operations on data, we first need to acquire the respective datatype from our DataSource. The DataSource ist preconfigured depending on the server implementation.

````
import {DataSource,DataService} from '../services/datasource'
import {autoinject} from 'aurelia-framework'

@autoinject
export class DoSomething{

  private service:DataService

  constructor(private ds:DataSource){
    this.service=ds.getService('ServiceName')
  }

  async actOnData(object){
    const created= await this.service.create(object);
    const fetched= await this.service.get(object.id);
    const updated= await this.service.update(object.id,newObject)
    const found = await this.service.find({query:{someAttribute: "someValue"}})
    const deleted = await this.service.remove(object.id)
  }
} 
````

## Events on stored objects

The DataService sends events about all objects it manages to all authenticated and authorized clients. To subscribe to an event, use something like:

````
exampleService:DataService

constructor(private ds:DataSource){
  this.exampleService=ds.getService('example')
  this.exampleService.on('created',this.objectWasCreatedFunc)
  this.exampleService.on('updated',this.objectWasUpdatedFunc)
  this.exampleService.on('patched',this.objectWasPatchedFunc)
  this.exampleService.on('removed',this.objectWasRemovedFunc)
}

objectWasCreatedFunc(obj){
  console.log("An object is born! "+JSON.stringify(obj))
}

````


## State

State is maintained by an instance of aurelia-store.  To follow the state of a random object, use something like the following code:

~~~~
import { connectTo } from 'aurelia-store';
import { pluck } from 'rxjs/operators';


@connectTo(store=>store.state.pipe(<any>pluck("something")))
export class SomethingHandler{

  /* 
    do something with 'state' which is the currently
    selected instance of 'something'.
   */ 
}
~~~~

If you want the complete state instead, things are even simpler:

~~~~
import { connectTo } from 'aurelia-store';
import {State} from ('../state')

@connectTo<State>()
export class SomeStateHandler{

  /* 
    do something with 'state' which is the complete current
    state of Webelexis.
   */ 
}
~~~~

If you're interested in a number of objects only, use something similar to:

~~~~
@connectTo<State>({
  selector: {
    actPatient: store => store.state.pipe(<any>pluck('patient')),
    actCase: store=>store.state.pipe(<any>pluck('case')),
    actKons: store => store.state.pipe(<any>pluck('konsultation'))
  }
})
~~~~

State objects are implicitly @observable, which means, you can monitor them with code like this:

````
actPatientChanged(newState,oldState){
  // do something
}
````

## Data types

### Finding

A finding is a type of data generated externally and repeatedly over time. Examples might be the Blood Pressure, or the body weight.

To record such data, we need:

* a finding definition (see src/models/finding-def.ts) for each finding type to use, which tells the system, how to set up the data structure.

* a list of such finding definitions (src/user/finding-defs.ts) to tell the system, which findings to manage. This list is user-supplied and must be created upon installation of the system.

* One concrete finding object (src/models/findings-model.ts/FindingType) for each finding type.

Helpers to manage findings are in findings-model: Finding-Manager and Finding-Model.

## Localization

### Setup

Translation files are in the directory /locales. There is a subdirectory for each supported languange with the ISO abbreviation, e.g. 'de' for german, 'en' for english and so on. More fine-grained translations are also possible, e.g. 'de_CH' or 'en_US'. To support a language, simply create a subdirectory for that language and copy 'translation.json' from 'de'. Then, change all values in that file to the new language (but leave the keys as-is).

German is defined as the fallback. So if a key is not found in the current language, the german version is displayed.

### Usage

We use aurelia-i18n, so a lot of documentation can be found there. Here only a short overview:

To translate html-files, use the t-attribute, e.g.

    <h2 t="some.title">Title</h2> 

This would look for

    "some":{
      "title": "Some Title"
    }

In the translation.json of the currently selected language. If it doesn't find that, it looks for the same object in translation.json of the "de" subdirectory. If still not founs, it displays simply "some.title" as the title. It will not show "Title" as probably expected. And the inner contents of the tag is completely optional. so `<h2 t="some.title>"></h2>` would yield exactly the same result.

To translate programmatically, use the I18N singleton:

    import {autoinject} from 'aurelia-framework'
    import {i18N} from 'aurelia-i18n'

    @autoinject
    export class SomeClass{
      constructor(pribate i18:I18N){}

      someOutput(){
        return this.i18.tr("some.title")
      }
    }

  Parameters are defined like this:

      "example":{
        "reallydelete": "Wollen Sie {{dingsbums}} wirklich l√∂schen?"
      }  

  and consume it like this:

    <p t="example.reallydelete" t.params.bind="params">

 where params are defined in the matching ViewModel, such as:

    class Something{
      params = {
        dingsbums: "Windows 10"
      }
    }   

Similarly, programmatically replace parameters like this:

    someOutput(){
      this.i18.tr("example.reallydelete",params)
    }

To localize dates, use markup like this:


    <p>Heute ist der ${new Date() | df : undefined : 'de'}</p>
